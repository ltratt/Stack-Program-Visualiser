# Stack Program Visualiser

## What Is This?

A simple interpreter and GUI visualiser for a very basic stack-based langage.

## Why Did You Make It?

This grew from a command line interpreter I wrote for a first-year lecture I assisted with. This serves a dual-purpose: it teaches about how a stack program works, and about how an interpreter works.

## How Do I Use It?

Download the whole repo, compile from source using `javac @sources.txt`, then run the program with `java StackProgramVisualiser`.

## Dude... Why Java? And Why _Swing_?!

Simple: this is an education aid, primarily for the students at my university. They learn Java and Swing (as I did when I was in their shoes), and I want them to be able to pick apart the code if they so wish.
